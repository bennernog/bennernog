- 👋 Hi, I’m @bny-mobile, call me Ben
- 👀 I’m interested in sci-fi, fantasy, arts & crafts, social dancing, graphic design and of course programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a Java developer, but I already did some programming in the past. I used to make android apps in Java, in C# and a a bit in Java & kotlin too. 
- I dabbled a bit in JavaScript (mainly in the goolgle Apps Script AP), and some other languages like objective-C, ruby & python, but not enough to claim any skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to expand my skills and get some experience, hopefully the coronapocalypse doesn't prevent me from getting an internship this summer
- 📫 How to reach me : 
      email: bny.mobile@gmail.com
